/// Signal container

/**
Components process and transfer data between each other in the form of "signals" via interconnected wires. SignalBuses are signal
containers. Via the Process_() method, a Component receives signals into its "inputs" SignalBus and provides signals to its
"outputs" SignalBus. The SignalBus class provides public getters and setters for manipulating its internal signal values,
abstracting the need to retrieve and interface with them directly.

Signals can be dynamically typed at runtime, this means a signal has the ability to change its data type at any point during
program execution. This is designed such that a SignalBus can hold any number of different typed variables, as well as to allow
for a variable to dynamically change its type when needed - this can be useful for inputs that accept a number of different data
types (E.g. Varying sample size in an audio buffer: array of byte / int / float).
